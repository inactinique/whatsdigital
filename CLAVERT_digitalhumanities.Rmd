# Introduction

<!-- 
   
That sounds like a lot to attempt in a short article, so you may find as you go that the scope shrinks. The core thing that I am hoping to get from the viewpoint of the book would be a discussion of , so questions such as
 
- Why was this term adopted over alternatives?
- What was it seen to mean at the time it was adopted?
- How has that meaning been contested, evolved, etc? Did the digital in digital humanities mean different things to different communities?
- Why, in all the debates about what DH is, who qualifies as a digital humanist, etc. has there been so little attention paid to trying to define or historicize digitality?
 
What you talk about in the first and second parts is relevant to this, in as much as it’s about digitality vs. humanities computing. To the extent that there’s been a huge effort to memorialize Busa, who obviously didn’t call himself a digital humanist, it emphasizes that this is just a rebranding of “humanities computing” (as well as broader points about constructing a mythical history).
 
So there’s an interesting dual history there: on the one hand digital humanities was invented as an identity circa 2001. (See Kirschebaum’s https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/f5640d43-b8eb-4d49-bc4b-eb31a16f3d06 which sems a useful starting point for this). On the other hand it goes back to the 1950s.
 
If I understand what you are saying for the second part, that might be asking why quantitative and statistical approaches to history haven’t been considered part of DH. Which is a reasonable question given that digitality is literally about digits. That also seems to tie in with the extent to which DH was just a rebranding of humanities computing, and also the extent to which its agenda was set by English Lit scholars rather than historians (as mentioned in the article linked above).
 
The idea of DH as a community and culture, which you mention for part 3, is also relevant in as much as the community has an implicit operational definition of what the digital in DH means that’s powerful, even if it’s been reluctant to engage explicitly with the concept or history of digitality.
 
Overall, then, I think the all topics you mention could be part of a chapter that would fit in the book, but I think you need some anchoring material there talking about what DH was taken to mean by the people who adopted it, as well as talking about how they mythologized a past to support this self-conception and about what that invented past leaves out. That doesn’t mean trying to invent your own analytical definition of what DH should be, just taking about what the “digital” in DH meant to the people who adopted it.

**what digitality has meant in the digital humanities**

Fifteen years ago, the author of this chapter was participating to a digital humanities “unconference”[^thatcamp]: among the many topics discussed, the participants wondered if 'analog' and 'digital' humanities would one day converge. One answer came out: it would not be possible to see both converge without traditional humanities adopting digital humanities' practices (and for instance unconferences, openness -- open access, open data and so on -- etc.) Those practices were not all digital *per se* -- some were induced by the use of digital tools, but others seem more to be a question of sheer traditions, not necessarily linked to the use of any digital tools. Wikis, for instance, did not invent collaboration. After all, digital humanities did not only relate to Humanities and computing -- there was something more, linked to what could be called culture, or traditions.

[^thatcamp]: That happened during THATCamp 2009. For a definition of what were THATCamps, please go to the now archived website: https://thatcamp.org/about/index.html. The anecdote here dates back to [THATCamp CHNM 2009](https://chnm2009.thatcamp.org/). One blog post discussing that can be read here: https://chnm2009.thatcamp.org/06/25/us-vs-them/index.html. The anecdote is narrated as it happened according to the author's memory -- it might have happened otherwise. 

What's digital in Digital Humanities? The answer seems obvious, but the twod words and the expression they are combined into bear ambiguities and ambivalences. None of them have easy definition, all the more that there are variations from one country to the other. We could also add that their history, their temporality -- from a centuries old word (Humanities) to an expression coined around 2004 for Digital Humanities -- are quite different. 'Digital' -- from latin, related to fingers and by extension numbers under 10 and, starting around 1945, what is related to computer opposed to analog technologies -- and 'Humanities', both latin words, but with meanings that are older for humanities, with strong traditions, and more recent with 'digital' (its change of meaning at least), and a tradition that is being built, in a way. That's what's digital humanities is trying to confront, centuries old traditions and a few decades old other one.  

Questioninig the digitality of Digital Humanities is questioning those definitions and temporalities and how they are confronting within the term "digital humanities". The aim of this chapter proposal is to evaluate the *digitality* of digital humanities. In *The Archived Web* (@bruggerArchivedWebDoing2018 Chapter 2, “The Digital and the Web”), Niels Brügger notes that many publications about "digital and X" (p. XX) have been published, without much reflection on what *digital* means. If we stand from a particular use of electricity that is at the center of the binary system that is a computer, *digital* means the use of '0' (no electricity) and '1' (electricity) as an alphabet (Finnemann, quoted by Brügger[^finnemann]). The problem of such a definition of *digital* is that 0/1 are to be seen as building blocks. Let's then follow Brügger:

[^finnemann]: Finnemann,	N.	O.	(1999).	Modernity	modernised:	The	cultural	impact	of computerisation.	In	P.	A.	Mayer	(Ed.),	Computer,	media	and	communication (pp.	141–159).	Oxford:	Oxford	University	Press.

>  In the present context, the term digitality is used to capture the specific ways in which the digital bits are materialized and combined in a concrete media artifact and in concrete texts.

So, what's the digitality of Digital Humanities? In other words, what's *digital* in the *digital* humanities? How did (still do) Digital Humanities set up specific ways to transform digital bits, to materialize them into concrete artefacts, and maybe more cultural ones (see notion of 'digital' as a culture (see @doueihiPourHumanismeNumerique2012). There are canonical definitions of Digital Humanities, the oldest one being in *A Companion to Digital Humanities* (2004, see below):

> Especially since the 1990s, with the advent of the World Wide Web, digital humanities has broadened its reach, yet it has remained in touch with the goals that have animated it from the outset: using information technology to illuminate the human record, and bringing an understanding of the human record to bear on the development and use of information technology. (http://digitalhumanities.org:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-1-3&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-1-3&brand=9781405103213_brand) (@schreibmanCompanionDigitalHumanities2004).

This definition -- that also describes the transition from Humanities computing to Digital Humanities -- describes a sort of return ticket of the Humanities to information technologies. But this return-ticket does not say much, in the end, of the digitality in the digital humanities, as it sends the definition of 'digital' to information technologies. 

The answer to those questions depends on *how* Digital Humanities can be defined. And this *how* is far from easy. Based on a database made of *Day of DH* quotes - a yearly event mobilising quite broadly the DH community --, Jason Heppler created the website [*What is Digital Humanities*](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com) that relies on around 800 different definitions of DH.

![Figure 1 -- Clustering (Hierachical desending Clustering, based on @reinertMondesLexicauxLeur1993 as implemented in the [iramuteq](https://iramuteq.org) application)](img/dayofquotes.png)

The Figure 1 is a distant reading (a quantitative approach) of those almost 800 quotes that looks for a definition of digital humanities: and there is obvisouly not much about 'digital' *per se*¨. Where are 0s and 1s? What digitality means to Digital Humanities?

# The History of Digital Humanities as a myth

<!-- The first part would start by analysing how DH have been writing their own history, building a myth (ie Roberto Busa), a myth is questioned since 2010-2012. -->

The usual narration of Digital Humanities history starts with a meeting between Roberto Busa, a Jesuit, and his project of indexing Thomas Aquinas' full work, with IBM chairman, Thomas J. Watson, in 1946. As Roberto Busa passed away in 2011 at 97, most generations of researchers in Humanities computing and, then, Digital Humanities could still read his foreword to *A Companion to Digital Humanities* @busaForewordPerspectivesDigital2004.

Busa's project, the *Index Thomisticus*, indexed, in the end, more than 10 millions words, in 56 volumes. The first of them was published in 1974 and the publication of all volumes was completed in 1980. In the end, the *Index Thomisticus* was a *digital* project -- in the sense that it used *digital* machines that were mainframes -- with paper (it began using punchcards) or analog (tapes) inputs  and paper outputs (books). The project was then transformed into CD-ROM (19192) and into a website (2005). In the end, this project bears analog as well as digital caracteristics, influenced numerous other projects, but also bears some aspects of a myth: a key person (Roberto Busa), an influence over several generations, the insistance on text and on ways to transform text inot something that can be computed and structured (lemmatization, concordances, etc).

Other usual steps of a traditional history of Digital Humanities include the creation of two associations - the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) in 1973 (today, the European Association for Digital Humanities) and the Association for Computer in the Humanities (1978), the former more european and the latter being more north-american. Starting in 1988, the two associations organised a conjoint annual conference. With the Association for Computational Linguistics, both created the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) consortium -- a major actor in Humanities computing and today in Digital Humanities that shows how Humanities Computing were rooted into the study of text. The TEI has has as a main mission to encourage *via* a common markup language the encoding and semanticization of the digital version of texts. The strong influence of computational linguistics but also of English departments (@kirschenbaumChapterWhatDigital2012) is often emphasized to explain tis part of DH history. In itself, the work within and between associations is a rather traditional (in the sense, here, of non-digital) one.

A more digital step if this history is the creation of the [*Humanist* Discussion Group](https://www.dhhumanist.org/) -- *Humanist* and not *Digital Humanist* nor *Conmputatinal Humanist* nor... -- by [Willard McCarthy](https://www.mccarty.org.uk/). 


<!-- to be developped -->

Around 2004, the switch from Humanities Computing to Digital humanities started. The first step of this switch was the publication of the *Blackwell Companion to Digital Humanities*, edited by Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens and John Unsworth. The three editors, in their introduction, present the book as a turning point in Digital Humanities as “for the first time, a wide range of theorists and practitioners, those who have been active in the field for decades, and those recently involved, disciplinary experts, computer scientists, and library and information studies specialists, have been brought together to consider digital humanities as a discipline in its own right, as well as to reflect on how it relates to areas of traditional humanities scholarship.” (@schreibmanDigitalHumanitiesHumanities2004) and then pay an hommage to the work of Roberto Busa, who wrote the Foreword (@busaForewordPerspectivesDigital2004). But, observing that the field has expanded, the authors suggest a sort of definition of digital humanities: “Especially since the 1990s, with the advent of the World Wide Web, digital humanities has broadened its reach, yet it has remained in touch with the goals that have animated it from the outset: *using information technology to illuminate the human record, and bringing an understanding of the human record to bear on the development and use of information technology*.” (emphasis mine). Later in this introduction, a short mention of Humanities Computing defines it as the “interdisciplinary core" of Digital Humanities.

The publication of the Companion seemed to open the way to a further institutionalization of Digital Huanities with the creation of the Association of Digital Humanities Organization (2005), an association regrouping DH associations, and being the main organizer of the regular series of Deigital Humanities conference, based on the former joint conferences of ACH and ALLC. This first annual DH conference was organized in paris, in the walls of the good old Sorbonne. Its website is not available anymore, but as an [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060705200829/http://www.allc-ach2006.colloques.paris-sorbonne.fr/).

The switch from Humanities Computing to Digital Humanities is quite obvious when we look at Google Trends, that reflects search queries with Google Search (Figure 2).

```{python, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read the csv file
df = pd.read_csv('data/gtrends_dh-hc.csv')

# Convert the 'Months' column to datetime
df['Months'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Months'])

# Sort values by date
df = df.sort_values('Months')

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Months'], df['digital humanities'], label='digital humanities', color='blue')
plt.plot(df['Months'], df['humanities computing'], label='humanities computing', color='red')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Number')
# plt.title('Digital Humanities and Humanities Computing Trends Over Time')
plt.legend(loc='best')

plt.show()

```

There are several possible interpretations about the switch from Humanities Computing to Digital Humanities and the changes in institutionalization that followed. The immediate origins of the *Companion* is one: the term *Digital Humanities* came up during exchanges between the editors and their publishers at Blackwell. In a way, it was a sort of rebranding: using an expression that was easily understandable (though not that welle defined), so that the book could reach a large audience. The introductory text of the *Companion* and other researchers (myself included) insisted on the long-term effects of the rise of the World Wide Web -- the editors of the Companion are insisting on “human record” and the digitization of the “human record” obviously found in the web a way of dissemination. Here, the crossing of datafication and networkization could be seen as one of the grounding stone of Digital Humanities. This rise of Digital Humanities -- whether because of a rebranding or of the advent of the web -- also gave birth to new digital practices in the Humanities: the switch to Digital Humanities corresponds also to a rise of newcommers (like myself in 2008).

In 2011, Roberto Busa, who wrote the foreword of the *Companion* (without using the expression *digital humanities*), passed away. A number of blogposts payed an hommage to his work, for instance on Stephen Ramsay's blog (@ramsayFrRobertoBusa2011). If Ramsay admits that Busa was part of a wider intellectual field, he claims is importance and influence in Digital Humanities. And quotes: “Perhaps the New Criticism was taking hold in some other part of the world, but for Busa, philology was the proper hermeneutical framework.” -- founding Digital Humanities in the old European tradition, pre-1945. Humanities Computing as founded on both computers and old (european) traditions, cautionning in advance later criticism of Digital Humanities (@allingtonNeoliberalToolsArchives2016).

If we can admit that Busa was part fo a wider intellectual field, why did his name because that central in Digital Humanities? Stephen Ramsay, quoting John Unsworth, seems to give the answer: “Most disciplines can’t point to a founding moment, much less a divine one.”

<!-- à développer -->

# A counter-history of Digital Humanities?

As Ramsay wrote in 2011, “Busa was one among the many who were striving to bring computer technology — then in its early infancy — to bear on humanistic problems back in the forties. Like most dh scholars today, he was part of a much wider intellectual network.“ But some part of this intellectual network are considered today as Digital Humanities fragments and some part are not. Focusing on the French School of the Annales in history, rarely mentionned as part of the 1950s/1960s inspirators of Humanities Computing and Digital Humanities, trying to look at the “digitality" of the Annales we will try here to understand, as a sort of negative of a picture, what's not digital in Digital Humanities. 

<!-- The second part would try to focus on alternative histories of DH, or rather what’s not in DH but still has some sort of digitality linked to the humanities.  For instance: what’s the digitality of the School of the Annales (the generation of Leroy-Ladurie, more precisely)? And why was it not considered Humanities Computing / DH? Is it linked to a difference in their digitality? -->

## Were the Annales digital?

In 1959, two French historian published an article that is the first in a major French speaking history journal to deal with what's yet not called in French “ordinateur” of “informatique”. Using “mécanographie”, François Furet and Adeline Daumard are explaining how they were able to deal with sort of massive data, e. g. notarial records of the 18^th^ Century (@francoisfuretMethodesHistoireSociale1959). Two years later, two archaeologists, in the same journal,  cross-referenced two databases to get more information on Assyrian presence in Cappadocia (@paulgarelliEtudeParOrdinateurs1961). Though probably less focused on text than Busa's work, the French historians belonging to the Annales school, and working with large statistical series such as Emmanuel Leroy-Ladurie (@laduriePaysansLanguedoc1966), have occasionally used the same computing facilities as Busa: the euratom facilities in Ispra, Italy, are explicitely mentioned by Garelli and Gardin (@paulgarelliEtudeParOrdinateurs1961) as well as by Busa (@busaForewordPerspectivesDigital2004)[^lejeune]. The use of mainframes and quantitative data fit quite well into the *longue durée* concept defined by Fernand Braudel (@braudelHistoireSciencesSociales1958a) in 1958. A famous sentence by Le Roy Ladurie from an article in a french newsmagazine, *Le Nouvel Observateur*, even described as the future quantitative historian as obligatorily being a “programmer” (@leroyladurieFinErudits1968).  

[^lejeune]: For more information on the Euratom facilities at Ispra and Digital Humanities: @lejeuneEuratomGeneseHumanites2022.

<!-- histoire quantitative diminue, blah blah, tout ça mais Moretti puis Underwood -->

In a way the Annales were integrated into DH after 2004, *via* Moretti and Distant Reading + History Manifesto and *longue durée* (linked to distant reading too).

To be linked to Ted Underwood's article on distant reading in litterature history => is not obligatory 'digital' (ie with computers).

What does it says about the importance of the digital and which digital was important in DH? Why linguistics was digital but not quantitative history? Whereas Busa - who also used the Euratom facilities in Italy for his project -- worked on the same mainframes than some French and Western-European researchers (Euratom).

## Current reassesment of digital humanities' history. Insistance on labor / digital labor (Busa, see Nyhan).

- Busa and digital (gender) labour (Nyhan)
- Demands for more inclusivity / diversity, etc (GO::DH and Fiormonte et al. 2021)? 
- DH and the toxic turn (Gold / Klein 2019)

(what about Svensson -- Landscape, etc DHQ --?)

# Digital Humanities beyond digitality

<!-- The third part would look at the more recent history of DH – DH itself – and look at DH beyond digitality: the question of practices, DH as a community, as a culture more than as a science or as a digital something. Defining DH as something more linked to non-digital cultural element, but based on the use of computing in the humanities. In other words, how the digital base of DH is giving birth to elements that are not digital in themselves.-->

Sources of this part: Will be based on manifesto of DH 20.0, which is in the end partly digital only. + introduction to the 4 volumes of debates in the digital humanities.

- manifesto of DH 2.0 (Presner, Drucker, etc)

=> DH as a community, as *avant-gardesque* of humanities and (for some aspects) social sciences. 

- manifesto Paris 

=> strong focus on interdisciplinarity

# Conclusion: a multilayered digitality?

 Conclusion would be more around the notion of digital culture, and DH as part of something larger and cultural.


Digitality as set of bits or sort of culture (Milad Doueihi, *Pour un hupanisme numérique*) -> digital as culture, not as digital *stricto sensu*. Gives a better hint of what are Digital Humanities: use of computers in Humanities, but also specific practices, even, maybe, specific set of research questions, etc (more collective, more community-ish, supposed to be more open). But still being part of Humanities for other kind of practices (academic association).

In fine, DH as caracterized with non-digital elements and digital ones. But question is: non-digital elements are still partly based on an encounter with the computer.

Could we talk of a sort of multi-layered digitality of Digital Humanities?

- digital *stricto sensu* -- no DH without computers
- transformation of bits into cultural digital objects
- Traditions / practices around those cultural digital objects
