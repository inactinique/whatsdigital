# 10 minutes presentation:

Just remember that I do not have the same background as most of you -- international historian / memory studies not history of science / technology / computing for instance.

- You start basically with the quite classical 1940s origins of digital something -- basically the rie of digital computers, then go to the present with generative AI and then you constantly play with interlaced temporalities -- showing that ‘digital’ in ‘digital image’ is not necessarily only connected to the digital computer, let’s say.

- it’s interesting to see that pixels were not the only way. You could even imagine a sort of virtual history of digital image

- it’s interesting to see the definition of digital image ‘discrete, comprised of standardised, monadic units assembled for a whole’ Because addressability, allows for the manipulation of visual media on a scale previously not possible.

- you historicize the pixel / picture element, showing its analog origin but also differences: analog images can be reduced to picture elements, digital images are constructed from these elements => they are first numbers.

Maybe here, a more straightforward comparison to ‘grain’ in silver photography could be interesting, to make it easier for the reader? 


- Ambivalence of pixel:
	- Connection between bits of memory and screen resolution
	- but a digital image can be printed on good old paper, stored with no relation to screens.

- question: ‘digital’ can be of different meanings depending on its output.

=> mediation

- notion de grille comme millénaire
	- here again, digital grid is at the same time something rooted in a longue durée, but with its particularity ie numerical representation and addressability, **random accessibility**.
	
- Materiality of the digital (output and display)
	- difference between the pixel of a screen and the pixel of an image
	

Could be simplified: the link to the screen could be simplified.
	
	
- Goal of most research into digital imaging = successful reproduction of existing visual forms. 
    - our culture is digital in w wide sense (use of technology)
    - but still analog in terms of content.
    
=> here, maybe you could go back to generative AI system =< the most digital images you can imagine but... still analog in a way as based on databases of images that are often digitised versions of analog born material / art.

=> the most digital version of digital images because they are the results of computing, calculation and are possible because the pixel exists. BUT based on training datasets of digitised images.



One remark:

- maybe some bridges ot be done with other chapters, about the ‘fingers’ thing. Analog activities as painting, photography, etc, required fingers, eye. Does this change with digital images

Where’s the body in digital images?

Question of the distance (see Cartier Bresson) to the object that is represented? What’s the distance? 

I think footnote 14 could be in the main text, not as a footnote. And maybe a way to discuss the fact that digital images may be rooted in analog culture and the fact that most of our culture is now the product of computer graphics.
