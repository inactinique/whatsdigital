# What’s digital in Digital Humanities?

## Opening remarks

As I said a few hours ago, I’m basically an international historian that came into crossing digital history and memory studies. No history of media, or history of technology or science.

Furthermore, it means that I may be sometimes an actor or direct witness of some elements that are in my chapter. In a non-developed yet part, I will talk about the Paris DH manifesto from 2010 - and I was one of the less than hundred guys who wrote it. As well as I start with an anecdote I have actually lived.

I wanted to start with the ambivalence of the definition of digital humanities, and the tensions of the two terms -- it’s not yet very clear in the draft.

I will not dare defining DH, but I will include Humanities computing (so starting in the 1940s). It’s in the ambiguity of DH that’s what’s digital and what’s not in DH can be seen. 
 
The first part would start by analysing how DH have been writing their own history, building a myth (ie Roberto Busa), a myth is questioned since 2010-2012. And then the switch to digital humanities and the nature of this switch in terms of digitality (rebranding / web and datafication / larger audience).
 
The second part would try to focus on alternative histories of DH, or rather what’s not in DH but still has some sort of digitality linked to the humanities.  For instance: what’s the digitality of the School of the Annales (the generation of Leroy-Ladurie, more precisely)? And why was it not considered Humanities Computing / DH? Is it linked to a difference in their digitality?
 
The third part would look at the more recent history of DH – DH itself – and look at DH beyond digitality: the question of practices, DH as a community, as a culture more than as a science or as a digital something. Defining DH as something more linked to non-digital cultural element, but based on the use of computing in the humanities. In other words, how the digital base of DH is giving birth to elements that are not digital in themselves.
 
Conclusion would be more around the notion of digital culture, and DH as part of something larger and cultural.

ie sort of layered digitality

## 

- speaks well about how digitality has been under historicized
- DH as under historicized and under-theorized
- more theoretical aspects of DH? 

Blanks?

- good anecdote 
- analog humanities? what is not digital? Other ways of what’s non digital.
	- tradition being aligned with what’s not digital: something new, ne methods, new tools
	- BUT way that digital gets conflated with information sciences

Two questions that the chapter is answering:
- what’s digital about digital humanities
- what’s digital humanities about digital humanities

Charts:
- distant reading of definitions of DH (MINE!)
 - not good approach to define DH
 	- not much about digital: computer, internet, etc. 

History of DH
	- Busa: technologies that are both digital and analog for the index
	- runs through much of the timeline of the chapter

Professionalization of DH: association, etc. 



Explain the chart
Does it tell us anything about what are DH?

What is digital humanities about? What’s the line? Just humanities using tools? 
DH being used for public history / DH as computational linguistics

WHERE PUBLIC HISTORY COMES INTO WHAT MAKES DH Digital
- not only analysis, but also wider audience, better access?

JUST TOOLS?

NGram not necessary, but interesting.

Conclusion: DH as digital culture, culture that links everything together.




> Valérie Schafer

Also about being recognized as DH / as belonging in the field. Comes back to traditions to publish in specific journals, speking at specific conferences. With new elements: values like publishing open access. 

> Tom

Have tried not to sell himself as digital historian. 

Fundamental incoherence that the paper has to deal with: DH as the hot new thing, the way to get positions, etc (around 2005), on the other way was never before humanities, but humanities computing. How can you go back to 1946 and be also buzzy since 2005.

Beyond that: tradition of computing in the 1960s, but tradition that was fades out in the 1990s. History went away from quantitative social sciences. So digitality of history 1960s has not been celebrated.

Arbitraire de ce qui est digital or not. Why at one point some historians identified themselves to be digital?

Identities in the past: cliometrics, quantiative history, etc, enabled by punch cards. But did not call themselves digital historian or data anlyst or whatever.

Busa: word frequencies = DH as pan-humanities mouvement, with quite different methods. 

Also hype-use for funding. At one point digitalness was supposed to transcend humanities with methods.

> Andrew Meade McGee

‘Digital Humanities industrial complex’ => three rival seperate DH shops. (including Ed Ayers; Scholar’s Lab and a third one). 

Talking a bit about networks: DH conferene, Unconferences, etc. Conference as Zeitgeist. To dig in the notion of what networks and networking means to the digital (Fiormonte!) Contradictions of the network aspect. To differenciate the earlier one and the transformation of the last 30 years. 

+ statistics about DH conferences.

> Jacob

**Goal of the piece?** Not one answer to the question. 
Presenting as an answer to that question, not exclusive one. 

Two DH: Humanities using digital methods with objets ; people using humanities methods to talk about digital objects.

> Valérie

moving notion that are difficult to grasp. What is non-digital in digital humanities?

> Tom

Do we need the question to be answered? yes. 
Why did they start to speak about digital humanities? 
No discussion about digitality in digital humanities. A symbol more than what digitality actually is.

Busa as founding saint because not really interested in digitality.

Busa as digital in retrospect.

My thoughts on popularity of DH. Regarder les Debates in the DH pour voir si débat sur digitality.

Here is something I wrote in 2014: "The digital humanities movement is a push to apply the tools and methods of computing to the subject matter of the humanities. I can see why young humanists trained in disciplines troubled by falling student numbers, a perceived loss of relevance, and the sometimes alienating hangover of postmodernism might find something liberating and empowering in the tangible satisfaction of making a machine do something. Self-proclaimed digital humanists have appreciably less terrible prospects for employment and grant funding as a humanist than the fusty analog variety. As Marge Simpson wisely cautioned, "don't make fun of grad students. They just made a terrible life choice."

It is not clear exactly what makes a humanist digital. My sense is the boundary shifts over time, as one would have to be using computers to do something that most of one's colleagues did not know how to do. Using email or a word processing program would not qualify, and having a homepage will no longer cut it. Installing a Web content management system would probably still do it, and anything involving programming or scripting definitely would. In fact, digital humanists have themselves been arguing over whether a humanist has to code to be digital, or if writing and thinking about technology would be enough. This has been framed by some as a dispute between the virtuous modern impulse to "hack" and the ineffectual traditional humanities practice of "yack."

We'll have to share gossip off chat another time, Frederic. I bet we can swap some wild GMU and UVA stories.
